**Tic Tac Toe**

A simple Tic Tac Toe game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to play 
alternately, with the loser of the last game getting the first turn in the next game.


**Understanding Event Handling Concepts**

**Event Delegation** : This is a technique in which instead of starting from child to the parent everybody listens 
for the event, we just delegate this task to the parent only to listen to the corresponding fired events.


*For example:*
        "In the game, `onClick={handleCellClick}` sets an event listener on the 
        `game-board`. If you click on any `cell` the event is also tracked by the `game-board`."
