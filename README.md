**Understanding Event Handling Concepts**

**Event Bubbling** : Event bubbling is a concept in which, if we trigger an event on any child, then that event is 
also tracked by ancestors of the corresponding child.

*For example:*
        "In the game, `onClick={handleCellClick}` sets an event listener on the 
        `game-board`. If you click on any `cell` the event is also tracked by the `game-board`."
